This is an experimental service I'm developing (see [the repo](https://github.com/gerrowadat/nomad-dns-exporter)) if you're interested.

All I really use consul for is simpe service discovery, so maybe I'll turnd own consul someday (and likely discover I use it for a lot more than simple service discovery, but at least then I'll know).
